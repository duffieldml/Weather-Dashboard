# Weather-Dashboard

Will you need a coat this morning? How are we supposed to know?! Do I look like a meteorologist? Well, you can by using this bad boy right here.

In all seriousness, the dashboard allows you to search for a city by name or zip code. It will save your recently searched cities on the side, allowing you to quickly look at the current weather conditions, UV index, and the 5 day forecast.

Utilizing Javascript and ajax get, we are able to use the weather API to get all this information. The javascript/jquery populates all this info into the html page.
